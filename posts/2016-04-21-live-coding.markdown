title: Live Coding
---

I've been watching some people code using LiveCodingTV and Twitch (I
prefer the first one), here's what I've learned so far about Live
Coding:

If you want to watch people code I recommend LiveCoding.tv , because
this community is focused on programming, Twitch is focused on gaming,
but there are some programmers that use Twitch. One thing I don't like
about Twitch is that, if some performer plays copyrighted music,
Twitch automatically detect it and removes that part of the audio from
previous recorded videos :(, we can't even hear the programmer's
voice. Maybe you can use Jamendo to set background Music.


The purpose of livecoding is to share your knowledge, the process of
building your product gets documented on video, also you let people
know about your product. Also LiveCoding.tv allows users to make a
donation.

## Perform a Live Coding Session

If you want to stream your coding session, you have to Sign Up to
Livecoding.tv or Twitch.tv .

If you chose LiveCoding, you can follow the
[Streamer Guide](https://www.livecoding.tv/streaming-guide/) to set up
your account and Streaming Software.

You can use [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/)
to Stream to LiveCoding or Twitch. OBS can be installed on Windows,
OSX and Linux.

There is another Client for Linux called
[AVCaster](https://github.com/bill-auger/av-caster), I haven't tried
it yet, but according to a LiveCoding newsletter, this software runs
better than OBS.

## My Experience Livecoding

I decided to start live coding, mostly because, as you may notice,
English is not my native language, and because I love programming and
learning new things. It is a very special experience. I got stuck a
lot of times with very simple issues, but I'm not used to be talking
and programming, streaming, etc, all at the same time. I really liked
the experience, I want to do it again, and make it better everytime.

I will develop a very simple Test/Quizz web page using AngularJS and
Scotty (Haskell Web Framework). 

You can check my channel and see my first live coding
