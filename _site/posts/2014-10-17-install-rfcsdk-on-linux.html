<p>This SDK is only available on the SAP Market Place. SDKs are available in the category called Additional Components. You are going to get a SAR file, this is a compressed file, to extract the files contained in this file you will need a tool called SAPCAR, that again is available at the SAP Market Place in the same category.</p>
<p>Now that you have both, SAPCAR and the SAR file, you should run the following command to extract your files:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    <span class="kw">SAPCAR.EXE</span> -xvf RFC_SDK1.4.SAR</code></pre>
<p>Note that your SAPCAR and RFCSDK.SAR file may be different depending on the version that you are downloading.</p>
<p>Running that command will generate a new folder called rfcsdk. The easy way to put that libraries in your system is to copy the contents of rfcsdk/lib to your /usr/lib path, and rfcsdk/include to /lib/include, obviously you must be root to do that.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    <span class="kw">sudo</span> cp rfcsdk/lib/* /usr/lib/
    <span class="kw">sudo</span> cp rfcsdk/include/* /usr/include/</code></pre>
<p>Now you have that libraries, needed by many programs and programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, in order to have a communication with the SAP System.</p>
